# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the existing WhisperX transcription pipeline into a professional FastAPI server that provides OpenAI-compatible audio transcription services. The server will maintain the intelligent language detection and audio processing capabilities of the original script while exposing them through a robust REST API interface that follows OpenAI's transcription API standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to transcribe audio files through a REST endpoint, so that I can integrate transcription capabilities into my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to `/v1/audio/transcriptions` with an audio file THEN the system SHALL return transcription results in JSON format
2. WHEN the request includes optional parameters (model, language, temperature, etc.) THEN the system SHALL apply these parameters to the transcription process
3. WHEN an invalid audio file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL return a 400 error with descriptive message
4. WHEN the transcription is successful THEN the system SHALL return a 200 status with transcription data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want OpenAI API compatibility, so that I can use existing OpenAI client libraries without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using OpenAI client libraries THEN the system SHALL accept the same request format as OpenAI's transcription API
2. WHEN returning responses THEN the system SHALL match OpenAI's response schema exactly
3. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL return error responses in OpenAI's error format
4. WHEN processing parameters THEN the system SHALL support all OpenAI transcription parameters (file, model, language, prompt, response_format, temperature, timestamp_granularities)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want intelligent language detection, so that transcriptions are accurate without manual language specification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no language is specified THEN the system SHALL automatically detect the language using multiple audio samples
2. WHEN language detection confidence is below threshold THEN the system SHALL use fallback detection without probability filtering
3. WHEN multiple languages are detected THEN the system SHALL select the language with highest vote count and confidence sum
4. WHEN language is explicitly provided THEN the system SHALL use the specified language without detection

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want multiple response formats, so that I can get transcriptions in the format that best suits my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN response_format is "json" THEN the system SHALL return structured JSON with segments and metadata
2. WHEN response_format is "srt" THEN the system SHALL return SubRip subtitle format
3. WHEN response_format is "vtt" THEN the system SHALL return WebVTT format
4. WHEN response_format is "text" THEN the system SHALL return plain text transcription
5. WHEN an unsupported format is requested THEN the system SHALL return a 400 error

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want efficient model management, so that the server can handle multiple models and optimize memory usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL load the default model into memory
2. WHEN a different model is requested THEN the system SHALL load and cache the model for reuse
3. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints to unload unused models
4. WHEN listing models THEN the system SHALL return all currently loaded models
5. WHEN loading a model fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error response

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want audio preprocessing capabilities, so that transcriptions work well with various audio qualities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio has leading silence THEN the system SHALL automatically trim it before processing
2. WHEN audio contains unwanted phrases THEN the system SHALL suppress specified tokens during transcription
3. WHEN processing audio THEN the system SHALL apply VAD (Voice Activity Detection) with configurable parameters
4. WHEN audio format is unsupported THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling, so that the API provides clear feedback for all failure scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file upload fails THEN the system SHALL return 400 with file-specific error details
2. WHEN model loading fails THEN the system SHALL return 500 with model error information
3. WHEN transcription fails THEN the system SHALL return 500 with transcription error details
4. WHEN invalid parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL return 422 with validation errors
5. WHEN system resources are exhausted THEN the system SHALL return 503 with resource error message

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want health monitoring capabilities, so that I can ensure the service is running properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GET request is made to `/healthcheck` THEN the system SHALL return service status
2. WHEN the service is healthy THEN the system SHALL return 200 with status details
3. WHEN dependencies are unavailable THEN the system SHALL return 503 with dependency status
4. WHEN checking health THEN the system SHALL verify model availability and system resources

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want configurable transcription options, so that I can optimize results for my specific use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN beam_size parameter is provided THEN the system SHALL use it for transcription decoding
2. WHEN temperature is specified THEN the system SHALL apply it to control transcription randomness
3. WHEN suppress_tokens are provided THEN the system SHALL prevent specified tokens in output
4. WHEN VAD options are specified THEN the system SHALL apply custom voice activity detection settings
5. WHEN timestamp granularities are requested THEN the system SHALL provide word-level or segment-level timestamps

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper logging and monitoring, so that I can debug issues and monitor performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL log request details and processing time
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log error details with appropriate severity levels
3. WHEN models are loaded/unloaded THEN the system SHALL log model management operations
4. WHEN transcription completes THEN the system SHALL log transcription metadata and performance metrics
5. WHEN system starts THEN the system SHALL log configuration and initialization status
